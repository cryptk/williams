# Pkg

This directory contains public packages that can be imported by external projects.

These packages should:
- Be stable and well-documented
- Have minimal dependencies
- Provide reusable utilities
- Not depend on internal packages

## Examples of what might go here:

- Shared utilities
- Custom error types
- Common validators
- Helper functions
- Constants that external consumers need

Only add packages here if they are meant to be used outside this project.
