# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets that are served directly without processing.

Place the following types of files here:
- Favicon and app icons
- robots.txt
- manifest.json
- Static images that don't need optimization
- Any files that should be copied as-is to the build output

Files in this directory are served from the root URL path.
For example, `public/favicon.ico` will be available at `/favicon.ico`.
